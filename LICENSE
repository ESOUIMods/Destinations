About the License and Original Author
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Destinations was originally created by SnowmanDK on 07/29/14. He has publicly confirmed that he no longer maintains the addon and has passed on stewardship to the community.

As of January 4, 2023, SnowmanDK acknowledged and appreciated the ongoing community maintenance of the addon. He has not revoked the original license, and it remains in full effect.

The original addon is licensed under an MIT-style license, which grants broad reuse rights with proper attribution.

Contributions made by Sharlikran (beginning on 2023-05-22) are licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License. This license applies only to changes and additions made since that date.

Some legacy features, such as questgiver tracking, have been removed in accordance with modern performance needs and console compatibility considerations. These decisions reflect the evolution of the addon, with respect to the original design and limitations of current ESO platforms.
