Destinations was originally created by SnowmanDK on 07/29/14. He has publicly
confirmed that he no longer maintains the addon and has passed on stewardship
to the community.

As of January 4, 2023, SnowmanDK acknowledged and appreciated the ongoing
community maintenance of the addon. He has not revoked the original license,
and it remains in full effect.

The original addon is licensed under an MIT-style license, which grants broad
reuse rights with proper attribution.

Some legacy features, such as questgiver tracking, have been removed in
accordance with modern performance needs and console compatibility
considerations. These decisions reflect the evolution of the addon, with respect
to the original design and limitations of current ESO platforms.
